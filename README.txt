How to compile the code
=======================
I have created a makefile to help with compliation of the code.
To complie the code simply type "make" (no quotes) in the command line.

How to run the code
===================
To run the code, I have added a simple compile flag to the makefile.
Simply type "make run" (no quotes) in the command line and the program
will begin to execute.

Notes
========
The makefile has a few other useful flags:
- make clean (will remove any binaries or files not needed anymore)
- make run   (will compile and run the code)
- make debug (will compile the code and show the compilation commands, as well as run the code)
